# Custom Sabers

## Installation
:::tip NOTE
Sabers need to be made specifically for Quest or PC and are not interchangeable between the two. You can tell which platform
a saber is for by the file extension. `.saber` files are for PC while Quest uses `.zip` files.
:::

### PC Sabers
The latest Custom Saber mod can be found in the [#pc-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG Discord
or in [Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant). Run Mod Assistant, select the Custom Saber mod,
and click Install. Once you've installed it you will see a folder called `CustomSabers` in
[your install folder](/faq/install-folder.md), this is where you should place the `*.saber` files you want to use.

You can download more sabers on [ModelSaber](https://modelsaber.com/Sabers/).

For those who want more customization to their sabers, [Saber Factory](https://github.com/ToniMacaroni/SaberFactory#readme)
allows you to create your own sabers in-game. You download parts and combine them like lego pieces with the ability to
change the shape, shaders, material properties, textures and more.

### Quest Sabers
Custom Sabers for Quest are provided by the Qosmetics mod. The latest version can be found in the
[#quest-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG Discord. Sabers are called `qsabers` and are currently
hosted in the [Qosmetics Community Discord](https://discord.gg/qosmetics).

## Usage

### PC Users
Inside the game in the main menu you will see on the left a `CUSTOM SABERS` or `SABERFACTORY` button under the `Mods` section.
Pressing it will open up the menu you can use to select which sabers you want to use.

::: tip NOTE
Once selected, the sabers will only show up only while a song is playing and not while in the menu.
:::

### Quest Users
Upload the `.qsaber` file to your Quest using the [BMBF Web Interface](/quest-modding.md#installing-mods).
You can then select which saber is active from the Qosmetics menu in-game.

## Creating Sabers
